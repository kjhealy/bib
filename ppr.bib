	faculties cannot obtain enough content for a conception of noumena
	that would assure their real possibility as objects, but can establish
	their merely formal logical possibility (Sections 2-3). Our practical
	reason, however, grounds belief in the real possibility of some noumena,
	and even knowledge of the noumenal reality of a free will (Section
	4). Section 5 defends Kant's conception of noumena as a good piece
	of philosophy, particularly with respect to its distinction between
	logical and real possibility. Are noumena numerically identical with
	experienced (phenomenal) objects? Kantian principles yield the answers
	that human selves are, God isn't, and it's harder to say about bodies

	Since the standard model represents only one understanding of desire

	could not be aware of the passage of time, hence, neither of change
	nor of motion. The subject cannot therefore be identified with any
	neural process, function, or location since whatever goes on in the

	Descartes and Leibniz because their nativism implies the denial of
	the awareness principle. And even when Locke defended the principle,

	human agents are, without distinction, evil, there is nothing in
	his basic conception of morality as grounded in the autonomy of practical
	reason that commits him to rigorism or to the unacceptable associated
	view. In the first part of the paper, I make some preliminary remarks
	about the idea of autonomy and furnish a setting for it by outlining
	Kant's view of the practical context of deliberation and choice.
	In the second part I examine Kant's descriptions of two conditions
	of human character, namely, frailty and impurity, as a means of dissociating
	the idea of autonomy from the rigoristic distinction. In the third
	part I go on to develop a notion of conditioned autonomy that does
	not involve rigorism and so allows us to draw moral distinctions
	between human agents. I conclude by indicating some close connections
	between the idea of conditioned autonomy and Kant's notions of virtue
	and impurity.},

	This paper contributes to the current debate by criticizing and revising

	data constitute semantic information only if they also qualify as
	contingently truthful. After a brief introduction, SDI is criticized
	for providing necessary but insufficient conditions for the definition
	of semantic information. SDI is incorrect because truth-values do
	not supervene on semantic information, and misinformation (that is,
	false semantic information) is not a type of semantic information,
	but pseudoinformation, that is not semantic information at all. This
	is shown by arguing that none of the reasons for interpreting misinformation
	as a type of semantic information is convincing, whilst there are
	compelling reasons to treat it as pseudoinformation. As a consequence,
	SDI is revised to include a necessary truth-condition. (edited)},

	must look beyond "Two Dogmas" to Quine's other critiques of analyticity

	the first case, the person's cognitive state has little to do with
	the event, but in the second, the mental state qua anger is quite
	relevant. How are we to understand this difference? What is the proper
	way to understand the relation between the mind, the brain, and the
	resultant behavior? This paper explores the popular "middle ground"
	reply in which mental phenomena are claimed to be "as real as" other
	higher level properties. It argues that this solution fails to answer
	epistemological difficulties surrounding how to chose the appropriate
	factors in an explanation. A more sophisticated understanding of
	scientific theorizing and of the relation between ontology and explanation
	give us a framework in which we can determine when we should refer
	to mental states as being the causally efficacious agents for some
	behavior.},

	than basic statements of self-knowledge, such as "I am thinking."
	On the other hand, there is the compelling Humean observation that
	when we introspect, nothing is found except for various "impressions."
	The problem, then, is that the Humean and Cartesian insights are
	both initially appealing, yet they appear to be in tension with one
	another. In this paper I attempt to satisfy both intuitions by developing
	a roughly descriptivist account of self-reference according to which
	our certainty in basic beliefs stems precisely from our needing to

	The neurophysiological probabilities pr(n(C)) and pr(n(H)) evolve
	continuously according to the different weights Jane's judgement
	attaches to C and H at different times during the deliberation. The
	overall process is indeterministic, since Jane's exact judgemental
	weighting would vary slightly were the process to be repeated from
	the same initial conditions. The weighting is however rational, and

	that forgiving is a task and that the disposition to undertake this
	task in the appropriate circumstances may properly be regarded as
	a virtue. However, to be too willing to undertake this task, or to
	undertake it in inappropriate circumstances, is a vice since it is
	indicative of diminished self-respect. Success in the task of forgiving
	falls beyond our full rational control and depends very largely on

	can be no argument for temporal parts based on the indiscernibility
	of identicals, which itself presupposes facts of identity rather
	than grounds them. Nor does David Lewis's so-called 'problem of temporary

	semantics of change goes, I advocate (as against adverbialism and
	relationalism) 'sententialism': temporal expressions, such as 'at
	t' or 'from t1 to t2', operate on whole sentences and may not be
	dropped from sentences expressing change without thereby entailing
	contradiction. Finally, although not every argument for the inconsistency
	of four-dimensionalism and change succeeds, I argue, via a discussion

	acts. This suggests that the relation underlying reasons explanation
	is not only causal, but singular as well. A further proposal, extracted

	in terms of nonmental triggers. But this suggestion underestimates
	the explanatory role of the environment at the time of action, and

	a reasoning process, we should not accept this belief. The claim

	different individuals, and these individuals' differential success
	results in the differential growth of gene lineages. So organisms
	affect evolutionary history only by determining which gene lineages
	prosper. Moreover, Dennett is an adaptationist: evolutionary history
	is dominated by selection. Second, Dennett thinks biological evolution
	is a special case of a more general phenomenon: evolution is "substrate
	neutral". So he is a friend of memes. Third, he argues that minds
	are adapted engines of behavioral control. While many would agree
	with this general thesis, Dennett argues that it has profound implications
	for theories of mind. I have reservations about Dennett's version
	of adaptationism, but the main critical thrust of this notice is
	with Dennett's second and third themes. (edited)},

	The third set of ideas concerns methodological questions about the

	will not take us far in attempting to explain intelligent agency
	and defends instead ideas about emergence. I am much more persuaded

	how intentional self- deception is possible in a single, coherent,
	Bayesian agent. On the author's account, self- deception is intentional
	in the sense that it is caused or sustained by the agent's intentionally
	interfering with her otherwise reliable cognitive processes -- for
	example, her attention, memory, reasoning, and evidence- gathering
	-- to bias them in favor of believing a proposition that which she
	desires to believe regardless of whether it is true. Thus, self-
	deception involves intentional biasing, not intentional lying. The
	author compares his intentionalist account to the anti- intentionalist
	accounts of Elster, Mele, and Johnston, and argues that the anti-
	intentionalist accounts do not satisfactorily resolve what Nisbett
	and Ross refer to as the "Basic Antinomy".},

	describing geometric essences as invariants through different types
	of free variations and I then link this to the mapping out of geometric
	invariants in modern mathematics. This view leads naturally to different
	types of spatial ontologies and it can be used to shed light on Husserl's
	general claim that there are different ontologies in the eidetic
	sciences that can be systematically related to one another. The paper
	is rounded out with a consideration of the role of ideation in the
	origins of modern geometry, and with a brief discussion of the use
